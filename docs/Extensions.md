# Toarnbeike.Options.Extensions 

This namespace provides extension methods for working with Option types, enabling functional programming patterns such as mapping, binding and side effects. 

These extensions are inspired by functional programming paradigms and are designed to work seamlessly with the immutable, allocation-free Option types provided by the Toarnbeike.Optional library.

### Choosing the right method

- Use [`AsNullable`](#asnullable) when you want to use an Option in a context that does not allow Options, such as EF Core.
- Use [`AsOption`](#asoption) if you received a nullable value from somewhere.
- Use [`Map`](#map) when transforming the value of an Option, while keeping the result as an Option.
- Use [`Bind`](#bind) when transforming the value of an Option, to a result that can also be an Option itself.
- Use [`Check`](#check) to verify if a condition is true for the given value, and return Option.None if it is not.
- Use [`Reduce`](#reduce) to finish using the Option and return the value, or an alternative if the value was `None`.
- Use [`OrElse`](#orelse) to replace a `None` with an alternative value, but keep the result as an `Option`.
- Use [`Tap`](#tap) for side effects on the value, while retaining the option for further chaining.
- Use [`TapIfNone`](#tapifnone) for side effects if the value is `None`, while retaining the option for further chaining.
- Use [`IsSomeAnd`](#issomeand) to check if a condition is true or false.

## AsNullable 

The `AsNullable` extension method allows you to convert the `Option` to a C# `T?`. 
This is used for contexts where `Option` is not allowed, such as e.g. EF Core.
`AsNullable` is a terminating operation: it return an `T?` that does not allow further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
User? nullableUser = user.AsNullable();
```

Due to C#'s implementation of nullable, separate extensions are required for value types, these are `AsNullableValue()`:

```csharp
Option<int> input = GetUserInput();
int? nullableInput = input.AsNullableValue();
```

Overloads are available for async `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## AsOption

The `AsOption` extension method converts an existing nullable value to an `Option`.
`AsOption` is a creating operation: it returns an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
string? nullableFirstName = GetFirstNameFromDatabaseForId(123);
Option<string> firstName = nullableFirstName.AsOption(); 
```

An overload is available for constructing an `Task<Option<T>>` from a `Task<T?>`.

--- 

## Map 

The `Map` extension method allows you to modify the value inside the `Option` by providing a mapping function from the original to the new value. 
It returns a new `Option` with either the transformed value, or `None` if the original value was `None`.
`Map` is a chaining operation: it return an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
Option<string> firstName = user.Map(value => value.FirstName);
```

Overloads are available for async mapping and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## Bind 

The `Bind` extension method allows you to modify the value inside the `Option` by providing a binding function from the original to a new Option.
This means that the result of the binding function can also be `None`, even if the original value was present.
If the original value was `None`, the result is still `None`.
`Bind` is a chaining operation: it return an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
Option<string> firstName = user.Bind(value => string.IsNullOrEmpty(value.FirstName) ? Option.None : value.FirstName);
```

Overloads are available for async binding and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## Check 

The `Check` extension method allows you to verify a condition on the value inside the `Option` and changing the value to `None` if the predicate fails.
If the original value was `None`, the result is still `None`.
`Check` is a chaining operation: it return an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
Option<User> activeUser = user.Check(value => value.Status == Status.Active);
```

Overloads are available for async checking and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## Match 

The `Match` extension method allows you to create a result from either the `Some` branch or the `None` branch.
`Match` is a terminating operation: it returns a result that does not allow further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
string result = user.Match(
  some => CreateUserLabel(user),
  () => "User not found"
);
```

Overloads are available for async matching and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## Reduce

The `Reduce` extension method allows you to substitute a value if none is present. Contrary to `OrElse`, this terminates the `Option`.
`Reduce` is a terminating operation: it returns a result that does not allow further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
string name = user.Map(value => $"{value.FirstName} {value.LastName}").Reduce("User not found");
```

Overloads are available for an async reduce `Task` and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

--- 

## OrElse

The `OrElse` extension method allows you to substitute a value if none is present. Contrary to `Reduce`, the result is still an `Option`.
`OrElse` is a chaining operation: it returns an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
Option<string> name = user.Map(value => $"{value.FirstName} {value.LastName}").OrElse("User not found");
```

Overloads are available for an async OrElse `Task` and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

---

## Tap

The `Tap` extension method allows to perform a side effect on the `Option<T>`, while returning the original `Option`.
`Tap` is a chaining operation: it return an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123)
	.Tap(value => logger.LogInformation($"Found user with first name {value.FirstName}));
```

Overloads are available for an async side effects and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

---

## TapIfNone

The `TapIfNone` extension method allows to perform a side effect on the `Option<T>` if it is in the `None` state, while returning the original `Option`.
`TapIfNone` is a chaining operation: it return an `Option` that allows for further chaining.

```csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123)
	.TapIfNone(() => logger.LogWarning("User with Id 123 not found."));
```

Overloads are available for an async side effects and `Task<Option<T>>` versions. 

---

## IsSomeAnd

The `IsSomeAnd` extension methods allow for checking a certain condition on an `Option<T>`. If the option is `None`, the result is always false. 
Otherwise, it checks if the provided predicate is true for the contained value.

``` csharp
Option<User> user = GetById(123);
bool isActive = user.IsSomeAnd(value => value.Status == Status.Active);
```

Overloads are available for an async side effects and `Task<Option<T>>` versions.
